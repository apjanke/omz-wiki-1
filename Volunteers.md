We're having a discussion on the need to have [a few moderators](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/2771)
as well as having some [general guidelines for new collaborators](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/2766)
in the project, whether they want to submit a patch, report a bug or just ask a question. Feel free to write your opinion!

### Project management

As you can see by looking at the project, we have a lot of pending Pull Requests and Issues. While there
are a number of people helping out by answering Issues and reviewing Pull Requests, I'd like to find
2-3 volunteers to assist me with organizing, reviewing, and helping me work through these.

#### Pull Requests

If you're feeling fairly savvy with Oh My Zsh have sent in pull requests/helped test other requests,
and know your way about the framework... and want to do this more often, do get in touch with me. If
you can volunteer 2-3 hours/week to help go through things, I'd love to speak with you.

#### Issues

Additionally, if you're just wanting to help out... I could use a few people to assist with organizing
new Issues. I'd like all the Issues to be properly labeled and assigned to people that can help those
items move forward. For example, if a bug comes in for a plugin reaching out to the original plugin
author to ask if they can help out would be great. (Basically... poking people and trying to help issues
get resolved and/or closed.)

### Contributions needed

- Many [plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins) are still missing a proper
ReadMe file
- Some wiki pages ([[Plugins]], [[Plugins Overview]], _etc_) need updating
