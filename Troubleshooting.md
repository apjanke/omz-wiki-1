This page is meant to describe the most common problems with oh-my-zsh and what you can do to diagnose them:

### Keyboard shortcut problems

Example: 
```shell
bindkey '^L' clear-screen
```

Two main things could go wrong:

1. The key sequence (`^L` in the example) does not match the key sequence being sent to the terminal:  

   You can see the exact sequence a keyboard shortcut sents by pressing `CTRL`+`V` and then the keyboard shortcut.
   For example: `CTRL`+`V`, `CTRL`+`L` will output `^L` (`^` represents the Control key).

2. The command executed (`clear-screen` in the example) has an error. In that case, post both the key binding and
    the definition of the command (if exists) like so:

   - **key binding:** `bindkey '^[[1;6D'`  
     will print `"^[[1;6D" insert-cycledleft`
   - **command definition:** `which insert-cycledleft`  
     will print `insert-cycledleft () { ... }`
  
     Notice that sometimes the command is a builtin [zle widget](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html)
     and so the `which` command won't work. If that's the case, just post the key binding and we'll figure it out.

### Completion problems

Many completion problems, including the infamous `command not found: compdef`, can be solved by resetting the completion system.

1. First, try to remove your completion cache with `rm ~/.zcompdump*`, close and reopen your shells.

2. If you still have problems, try fully resetting the completion system, as explained by
    [**@dragon788**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/630#issuecomment-70291622).

### Everything else

As a last resort, if you're getting weird behavior and can't find the culprit, run the following command to enable debug mode:
```shell
zsh -xv &> >(tee ~/omz-debug.log 2>/dev/null)
```
Afterwards, reproduce the behavior (_i.e._ if it's a particular command, run it), and when you're done, run `exit` to stop
the debugging session. This will create a `omz-debug.log` file on your home directory, which you can upload to
[gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/) and link to it on the issue you'll open next.
